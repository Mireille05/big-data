# User Input and Functions

This repository contains solutions to basic Python programming tasks that focus on using `input()` and functions to interact with users and process data. Each task is implemented as a separate Python script.

## Question 1: Age Calculator Using a Function

### Description:
This program prompts the user to:
- Enter their **name**
- Enter their **year of birth**

It then:
- Calculates the user's age assuming the current year is **2025**
- Displays a message in the format:  
  **"Thank you\n[Name], your age is: [calculated age]"**

### Concepts Used:
- User input with `input()`
- Type casting using `int()`
- Function definition and calling
- String formatting

## Question 2: Palindrome Checker

### Description:
This program:
- Asks the user to enter a string
- Checks whether the string is a **palindrome** (reads the same forwards and backwards)
- Outputs either:
  - `"Yes, it is a palindrome"` or  
  - `"No, it is not a palindrome"`

### Concepts Used:
- User input with `input()`
- String manipulation and comparison
- Function definition
- Conditional statements
